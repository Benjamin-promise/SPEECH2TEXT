# Speech-to-Text Conversion

This is a Python-based speech-to-text conversion program that uses the `speech_recognition` library to transcribe audio captured from the microphone into text. It utilizes Google's Speech Recognition API for processing.

## Features

- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text in real-time.
- **Ambient Noise Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts to background noise for better accuracy.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback when the audio cannot be recognized or if there are connectivity issues.
